He came close to the podium only in the 200m butterfly, where he finished fifth. From then on, he would dominate the next four Games, finishing the most decorated athlete at every one.

Phelps won eight golds – every event he entered – and broke World Records in seven of them. His record looks unlikely to be surpassed any time soon. Phelps left Athens with six gold and two bronze medals. His eight total medals tied him with Soviet gymnast Aleksandr Dityatin for the most medals ever won by a competitor at a single Olympic Games.

He is retired and is married to Nicole, with whom he has three sons, Boomer, Becker, and Maverick. But made a comeback during 2014.

In his final race, a 4x100mm medley relay, he clocked a 47.12 second run, the fastest split of his career. In all, the multi-gold medalist etched 29 long-course meter world records in individuals, eight world records in relays, and he won the most FINA world championship titles with 33.
